/*
 * File Overview: Implements the WPILib TimedRobot lifecycle and hands control to RobotContainer.
 * Features/Details:
 * - Constructs RobotContainer once to wire subsystems, commands, and autos.
 * - Runs CommandScheduler every 20ms in robotPeriodic to service bindings and subsystem periodic.
 * - Manages mode transitions: cancels auto at teleop, clears commands in test, seeds autos from chooser.
 * - Simulation hooks provided (simulationInit/Periodic) if running in sim.
